= MySQL Scaffold

This repository is a scaffold for running a MySQL instance in place. This instance runs in its own separate process, with its own data directory.  It uses the system mysql binary, but runs isolated from other MySQL processes. 

Currently depends on XAMPP to be installed, but will be refining to work with any existing installation of MySQL.
